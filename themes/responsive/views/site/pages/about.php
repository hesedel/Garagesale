<p>Stycle was founded in May 2014 by a team of University students; Adam, Amy, Hes and Marsha. The problem they aimed to solve was the need for students to be able to source affordable products for their studies and everyday living while they were at University. Through user research, they identified that community, security and the need to be able to access the site through mobile devices were important. And thus, Stycle was built. Stycle evolved when University staff members showed interested in posting affordable items for students as they too believed in the importance of 'community'. And Stycle was launched an online campus community for University staff and students to buy and sell.</p>
